        <p style="text-align: justify;">The soul of Kerala resides in the rustic terrains of villages that evoke fresh
            experiences on every visit. Village life of God's Own Country is a symphony composed on strings of beauty
            painted with myriad traditions and cultures.
            Untouched and untrodden by the dark hands of industrialisation and nauseating makeover of urban
            sophistication, the rural life of Kerala offers travellers a pristine, peaceful, indigenous experience.
         </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The concept of Village Life Experience in the tourism sector was first
            introduced by the Responsible Tourism Mission. It was brought forward with the aim of protecting the native
            crafts, traditional jobs and the village life of Kerala. The main highlight of this idea is that it ensures
            public participation for tourism development thereby supporting farmers, small-scale entrepreneurs,
            traditional artisans and so forth. Currently, RT Village Life Experience is an ideal model that has received
            praise and appreciation from all over the world. The Mission offers half day and full Village Life
            Experience packages. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the Village Tourism Experiences, Responsible Tourism introduced many
            innovative tour packages. RT decided to introduce tour packages incorporating weaving centres of Kalliasseri
            in Kannur, bell metal making of Kunhimangalam, Various Theyyams, visits to agricultural areas and
            traditional fishing techniques.
            New Cultural Tour Packages, Festival Packages, Experiential Packages that give more importance to tent
            accommodations, Heritage Tour Packages, Carbon Free Packages, Fishing Packages, Farming & Craft Village
            Packages and Story Telling Packages will be introduced soon.
